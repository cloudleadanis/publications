# Structurizr Advanced

## Mastering the Art of Visualizing Complex Architectures

These series of articles aim to take a stepwise approach and ultimately cover a comprehensive overview of the C4 Model and how to use Structurizr domain specific language (DSL).

Models evolve over time, and as such new complexity can be introduced into an already complex system.
As a Solution Architect, you will, from time to time, find yourself in such scenarios where there are a number of advanced topics and nuances you may still be expected to know.

Consider the following aspects of Structurizr as you create, update and rearchitect complex systems.

### 1. Advanced Structurizr DSL Features

 • Element Tags and Styling:
The article briefly mentions themes, but doesn’t cover how to use tags to apply custom styles to specific elements.
 • Example: Customizing colors for people, systems, or containers using tags.

```
container "Web Application" {
tags "WebApp"
}

styles {
element "WebApp" {
background "#ffcc00"
color "#000000"
}
}
```

 • Groups and Clustering:
Structurizr supports grouping containers or components (e.g., into microservices or bounded contexts), which is useful for larger systems.
```
group "Customer Services" {
container "Order Service" { ... }
container "Payment Service" { ... }
}
```

 • Custom Shape and Icon Support:
Adding icons or non-standard shapes for elements can make diagrams more intuitive for stakeholders.

### 2. Enterprise-Scale Use Cases

 • Large-Scale Modeling:
Techniques for managing and scaling large workspaces with multiple software systems. For example:
 • Partitioning a large architecture into multiple workspaces.
 • Using external software systems defined in other workspaces.
 • Cross-Team Collaboration:
Guidance on how to use Structurizr effectively across multiple teams, integrating diagrams into CI/CD pipelines, or automating updates to architecture documentation.

### 3. Deployment and Environment Modeling

 • The article briefly mentions deployment views but doesn’t dive deep into:
 • Modeling multiple environments (dev, test, production).
 • Capturing deployment constraints like cloud regions, scaling strategies, or failover.
 • Mapping containers to physical infrastructure like Kubernetes pods, VMs, or cloud services.

### 4. Integration with Other Architecture Tools

 • Tool Comparisons:
You may be expected to understand when to use Structurizr vs other tools like PlantUML, Lucidchart, ArchiMate, or Visio.
 • Integration with Architecture Repositories:
How Structurizr diagrams fit into broader architecture governance, including integration with tools like Confluence or SharePoint.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

 • While the C4 Model focuses on system structure, real-world architecture often involves documenting non-functional requirements (NFRs):
 • Scalability, performance, security, compliance, or cost considerations.
 • Representing these in C4 diagrams (e.g., annotating systems or containers with SLAs, encryption protocols, etc.).

### 6. System Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns

 • Patterns:
Familiarity with common architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven architecture, CQRS, or layered architecture) and how to represent them in C4 diagrams.
 • Anti-Patterns:
Knowing how to spot and avoid overengineering in diagrams, unnecessary duplication of elements, or missing dependencies.

### 7. Real-Time Use in Workshops

 • Facilitating Whiteboard Sessions:
The article doesn’t address how to use the C4 Model interactively during architecture workshops to collaboratively model systems with stakeholders.
 • Iterative Diagramming:
Understanding how to create initial rough diagrams and refine them over time with Structurizr DSL.

### 8. Advanced Dynamic Views

 • The dynamic views section doesn’t explore:
 • Detailed runtime interactions (e.g., sequence diagrams with multiple actors).
 • Representing asynchronous communication (e.g., messaging queues).

### 9. Beyond Software Architecture

 • While the C4 Model is software-focused, architects are often expected to model business processes and data flows. Structurizr doesn’t natively handle these, so you’ll need complementary tools or techniques.

### 10. Governance and Compliance

 • How to ensure diagrams conform to organizational architecture standards, particularly in regulated industries.
 • Using C4 diagrams as part of architecture reviews or audits.

### 11. Common Misconceptions

## You must be prepared to clarify or avoid these misunderstandings

### C4 is not ArchiMate

Understand the difference between these modeling approaches and when to use each.

### C4 is not detailed UML

While the Code (Level 4) diagram can resemble UML, C4 intentionally avoids the complexity of UML for most use cases.

By mastering these areas, you will be equipped to handle the expectations of a Solution Architect beyond what is covered in the article.
